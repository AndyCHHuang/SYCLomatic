# Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool

Intel staging area for llvm.org contribution. Home for Intel LLVM-based projects:

Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool is a new tool that will assist developers in migrating some portion of their existing code written in CUDA\* to the newly developed DPC++ language. Our experience has shown that this can vary
greatly, but on average, about 80-90% of CUDA\* code in applications can be migrated by this tool. Completion of the code and verification of the final code is expected to be manual process done by the developer.

Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool is to make it as easy as possible for customers to migrate their existing CUDA\* codebase to DPC++. DPC++ is an open specification for a portable, architecture-neutral language for expressing parallelism, which is based on industry standards. The DPC++ specification can be implemented by anybody for any platform. Once a customer migrates their code to DPC++, they are no longer tied to a single platform.
