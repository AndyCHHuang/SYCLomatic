rem This etc\dpct\vars.bat script is intended to be _sourced_ directly
rem by the top-level setvars.bat script. This vars.sh script is not a stand-alone
rem script. A component-specific vars.bat script is only required if the top-level
rem global environment variables defined by setvars.bat are insufficient for the
rem component that is providing this vars.bat script. For example, if a special
rem %CMPLR_OPT_ROOT% variable needs to be defined or some other
rem component-unique env vars are needed. It is possible that a component needs to
rem augment the top-level global env vars because some of the component's files
rem are in unusual locations that are not referenced by the global environment
rem variables defined by setvars.bat.

rem NOTE: See the setvars.bat script for a list of the top-level environment
rem variables that it is providing.
