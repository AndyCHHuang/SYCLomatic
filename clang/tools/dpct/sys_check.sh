# Intel(R) DPC++ Compatibility Tool System Check
#
# 'echo' should be used for outputting messages in response to errors. 'echo' is always output.
# 'speak' outputs only if the -v verbose flag it used. Affirmative messages ( "Everything OK!" ) should
#    use 'speak', as well as advice, informative messages, or possibly longer explanations of an error. (eg "your cmake installation is not the latest" )
#
#  colors for use with 'echo' and 'speak' are defined.  See  common.sh for list and usage example.
#
# any arguments passed to the root syscheck script are passed on to this one.

# ERRORSTATE: 0 if OK, 1 if not.
