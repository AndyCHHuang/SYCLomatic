# This etc/dpct/vars.sh script is intended to be _sourced_ directly
# by the top-level setvars.sh script. This vars.sh script is not a stand-alone
# script. A component-specific vars.sh script is only required if the top-level
# global environment variables defined by setvars.sh are insufficient for the
# component that is providing this vars.sh script. For example, if a special
# ${CMPLR_OPT_ROOT} variable needs to be defined or some other
# component-unique env vars are needed. It is possible that a component needs to
# augment the top-level global env vars because some of the component's files
# are in unusual locations that are not referenced by the global environment
# variables defined by setvars.sh.

# NOTE: See the setvars.sh script for a list of the top-level environment
# variables that it is providing. Also, if a comoponent vars.sh script must
# augment an existing environment variable it should use the prepend_path() and
# prepend_manpath() functions that are provided by setvars.sh. If it is not
# sourced by setvars.sh this test should generate an error message and may
# generate unkown function
