// TODO: Make the format for comments and warnings/errors the same
// The format for arguments is %0 for warnings/errors and {0} for comments.
// A warning, note and error may not have the same ID, but comment can have the same ID with warning or note or error.
// A comment and diagnostics with the same ID have the same index space for format arguments:
// warning may use %0 and comment may use {1} and in that way they are using different parts of parameter pack


// FORMAT: {NAME, ID, MESSAGE}
